# Anno Tool
Small tool for calculating ratios of production chains.

- [Data folder](data) contains basic data for calculations
- [Productivities](custom_productivity.txt) Easy way to enter productivities without changes in the code

Additional way of adding a productivity is by adding the productivity directly in the code. 

## How to use
- `endproduct`: name of the resulting product you want to calculate ratios for
- `endnumber`: number of buildings you want to use for endproduct

## Todo
At the moment all products are listed with german names and not all items are listed. 
Arctic products are missing completely and new world is mainly added for produciton for old world.
